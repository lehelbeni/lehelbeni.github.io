# The cisterns of the posterior fossa - Cisternae infratentoriale

- The membrane  of Lilequist separates the chiasmatic and interpeduncular cisterns.
- The anterior pontine membrane separates the prepontine and cerebellopontine cisterns
- The medial pontomeullary membrane separates the premedullary and prepontine cisterns.
- The lateral pontomedullary cistern separates the cerebellopontine and cerebellomedullary cisterns.

The subarachnoid space expands in the infratentorial compartment around the brainstem caudal to the tentorial incisura creating compartments filled with cerebro spinal fluid. The subarachnoid space is divided by numerous trabeculae septa and arachnoid membranes that extend the space between the inner pia mater and the outer arachnoid space.

## The membrane of Lilequist
Lilequist's membrane from the outer arachnoid membrane covering the posterior clinoid processes and dorsum sellae. As this membrane spreads upward from the dorsum and across the interval between the oculomotor nerves, it gives rise to two separate arachnoidal sheets. 
	- The Superior Sheet, the **diencephalic membrane**, extends upward and attaches to the diencephalon at the posterior edge of the mamillary bodies and separates the chiasmatic and interpeduncular cisterns. It  is the thicker of the two and is more frequently without perforations so that it acts as a barrier to the passage of air or other substances through the subarachnoid space. Many arachnoid trabeculae fan out from the superior edge of the diencephalic membrane to attach to the stalk of the pituitary gland, the mamillary bodies, and the posterior cerebral and posterior communicating arteries.
	- The inferior sheet, called the **mesencephalic membrane**, extends backward and attaches along the junction of the midbrain and pons to separate the interpeduncular and prepontine cisterns. It is thinner, more frequently incomplete, and contains an opening through which the basilar artery ascends to reach the interpeduncular fossa. The mesencephalic membrane may form a tight cuff around the basilar artery, but it more commonly has a large opening through which the basilar artery ascends
The lateral edge of the diencephalic and mesencephalic membranes attaches to the arachnoidal sheath surrounding the oculomotor nerves. The interpeduncular cistern communicates with the crural and ambient cisterns, which are situated in the tentorial area between the temporal lobe and midbrain. The oculomotor nerves course in the lateral wall of the interpeduncular cistern and form the pillars to which the leaves of Liliequist's membrane attach. In addition, the oculomotor nerves are the site of attachment of other arachnoid membranes that separate the cisterns of the junction of the supra- and infratentorial areas.
