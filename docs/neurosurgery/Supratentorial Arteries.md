# Supraclinoidal portion of the internal carotid artery (ICA)
## Segments of the Internal Carotid Artery
- C1 - Cervical portion
	- From the **carotid bifurcation** to the **external orifice of the carotid canal**
- C2  - Petrous segment 
	- From the **external orifice of the carotid canal** along the carotid canal contained inside the petrous portion of the temporal bone until it enters the **cavernous sinus**
- C3 - Cavernous segment
	- contained in the cavernous sinus it end where the artery passes through the dura mater forming the roof of the cavernous sinus
- C4 Supraclinoid segment
	- it begins where the artery enters the **supraclinoid space** and terminates at the **bifurcation into the ACA A.Cerebri Anterior and MCA A. Cerebri Media**. The C4 begins where the artery emerges from the dura mater, forming the roof of the cavernous sinus. It enters the cranial cavity by passing along the medial side of the anterior clinoid process and below the optic nerve. It courses posterior, superior, and slightly lateral to reach the lateral side of the optic chiasm and bifurcates below the anterior perforated substance at the medial end of the sylvian fissure to give rise to the ACA and MCA. The C4 segment is defined as including the crotch from which the MCA and ACA arise, and the branches originating from the apex of the wall between the origin of the ACA and MCA are considered to be branches of the ICA, just as aneurysms arising at this apex are considered to be aneurysms of the bifurcation of the ICA.
